# Guess-The-Number

This is my first ever Python project that introduced me to programming. 'Guess The Number' is a fun script that uses the random library to pick a random int between 
1 and 100 and then asks the user to input his guess. If the number that was given by the user is correct the corresponding message is displayed. Otherwise, the user is
informed about whether their guess was higher or lower than the random number and they can try again, as many times as they want.

The second script was created to show the progress I made, by adding the necessary controls to make sure that the input is always an int. If it is a float the user is informed that
their input has been rounded. If it's a string, the user is informed that the input is invalid.
